  this article, we explain the intuition behind an image processing
  technique called <i>Poisson Blending</i>. This technique is an image
  processing operator that allows the user to insert one image into
  another, without introducing any visually unappealing
  seams. Furthermore, this technique also makes sure that the color of
  the inserted image is also shifted, so that the inserted object
  feels as if it is part of the environment of the target image. So a
  bright object copy-and-pasted into a rather dark image, will have
  its color shifted to a darker color. In the below image, an image of
  a kitten has been copy-and-pasted into an image of a library using
  poisson blending, and as can be observed, there are no visible
  seams.

  This article explains how to implement the concepts first described
  in Section 2 and 3 of <a href="#refone">[1]</a>.

</p>

<h2>Image Gradients as an Image Encoding Scheme</h2>

<p>

Before we can explain poisson blending, a more fundamental concept
must first be clarified to the reader: image gradients. In the
following explanation, a one-dimensional grayscale image will be used
for explanations, in order to simplify the mathematical expressions. Consider the
following bar chart
</p>

<p>
  <a href="/img/poisson_blending/barchart_original.svg">
    <img class="article-img"
         src="/img/poisson_blending/barchart_original.svg"
         alt="barchart of target image" title="barchart of target image"
         width="40%" height="40%"/></a>
</p>

<p>
The bar chart represents a grayscale image, where the first pixel has
a grayscale value of $f_1 = 6$, the second one $f_2=4$, and so on. As
can be observed, the image has a pixel width of 8, and
it is visualized as a grayscale image below

</p>

<p>
  <a href="/img/poisson_blending/targetgray.png">
    <img class="article-img"
         src="/img/poisson_blending/targetgray.png"
         alt="visualization of target image" title="visualization of target
         image"
         width="80%" height="80%"/></a>
</p>

<p>
One approach to encoding this image is by simply saving the grayscale
values of every pixel, $f_1, f_2,\dots f_8$. However, an alternative
way of representing them, is to instead store the <i>gradients</i> of
every pixel. In one dimension, the gradient is simply the
derivative. As an example, the derivative in the positive
$x$-direction at $f_3$ can be found from the definition of the
derivative

\[
\frac{f_{3 + \Delta x} - f_{3}}{\Delta x} = f_{4} - f_{3} = 2
\]

Where we have let the step-size be $\Delta x = 1$. This is how the
gradient of a pixel in an image is defined. We denote the above
derivative as $v_{4,3}$, and in general, we define the gradient
between the pixels $p$ and $q$ as $v_{p, q} = f_p - f_q$. This value
is simply the change in grayscale intensity, as we go from $q$ to
$p$. Something that is remarkable, is that we simply need to store all
gradients, and some
<i>boundary conditions</i> in order to encode the entire image.

</p>

<p>

  We now demonstrate how the pixels represented by the yellow bars can
  be encoded(we shall deal with the gradients in both the positive and
  negative directions, and we do this to keep our notation consistent
  with the one used by <a href="#refone">[1]</a>. It is actually only
  necessary to store the positive gradients). Their gradients are
  $v_{2,3} = 1$, $v_{3,2} = -1$, $v_{3,4} = -2$, $v_{4,3} = 2$,
  $v_{4,5} = 1$, $v_{5,4} = -1$, $v_{5,6} = -2$, $v_{6,5} = 2$,
  $v_{6,7} = -2$, and $v_{7,6} = 2$. Given only these values, it is
  not possible to restore the values of the yellow bars. However, if
  we also have the boundary conditions $f_2 = 4$ and $f_7 = 8$(which we
  hereon denote as <i>boundary conditions</i>), then it becomes
  possible to recover the values of $f_3$, $f_4$, $f_5$ and
  $f_6$. Because since we know that $v_{3,2} = f_3 - f_2 = -1$, and
  given our boundary condition $f_2 = 4$, we can solve for $f_3$:

\[
f_3 = v_{3,2} + f_2 = -1 + 4 = 3
  \]

  Following this, we can easily solve for $f_4$, using our given value
  for $v_{4,3}$, and so on. To conclude, given the boundary
  conditions, and the values of the gradients, we can always recover
  the original image.

</p>

<p>

  We have just recovered the original image though hand calculation,
  but we of course also need to construct an algorithm that we can
  describe to the computer. We will recover the image by formulating
  an optimization problem, and solving it. For the pixels $f_3$ and
  $f_4$, the difference between them should be as close as possible to
  $v_{4,3}$. This means that the quantity $(f_4 - f_3 - v_{4,3})^2$
  should be as small as possible(we square it to remove any negative
  values. We are merely interested in how close this value is to zero,
  not its sign). The same statement should be true for all the
  adjacent pixel pairs, and all these pairs will have such a squared
  difference term associated with them. Summing all these terms up, we
  obtain the energy function $h$

  \begin{align*}
  h(f_3, f_4, f_5, f_6)& =\\
  &(f_3 - f_2 - v_{3,2})^2 + (f_2 - f_3 - v_{2,3})^2 \\
  &(f_4 - f_3 - v_{4,3})^2 + (f_3 - f_4 - v_{3,4})^2 \\
  &(f_5 - f_4 - v_{5,4})^2 + (f_4 - f_5 - v_{4,5})^2 \\
  &(f_6 - f_5 - v_{6,5})^2 + (f_5 - f_6 - v_{5,6})^2 \\
  &(f_7 - f_6 - v_{7,6})^2 + (f_6 - f_7 - v_{6,7})^2 \\
  \end{align*}

  By minimizing this function, we will find the values of $f_3$,
  $f_4$, $f_5$ and $f_6$ that as close as possible preserve the values
  of the given gradients. By finding these values, we will have
  recovered the original image from the gradients. Observe that $h$ is
  quadratic in terms of its variables $f_3$, $f_4$, $f_5$ and $f_6$,
  so minimization can be done by finding the partial derivatives with
  respect to all these variables, and then finding the point at which
  all these partial derivatives are zero. As an example, we take the
  partial derivative with respect to $f_5$.

  \begin{align*}
  \frac{\partial h}{\partial f_5}  &= 0 \\
  2(f_5 - f_4 - v_{5,4})- 2(f_4 - f_5 - v_{4,5}) - 2(f_6 - f_5-
  v_{6,5}) + 2(f_5 -f_6 - v_{5,6})  &= 0\\
  \end{align*}

  since $v_{p,q} = -v_{q,p}$ simplification gives us

  \begin{align}
    2f_5 - f_4 - f_6  &= v_{5,4} + v_{5,6} = -3
    \label{eq:partialderiv}
  \end{align}

  The gradients, which are already known, are on the right side, and
  on the left-hand-side we can find our unknown variables, $f_5$,
  $f_4$ and $f_6$. We will obtain a similar result when computing the
  partial derivative with respect to $f_4$. For $f_3$ and $f_6$, the
  result is different, since the boundary conditions must be taken
  into account. For $f_3$, we find that

  \begin{align*}
    2f_3 - f_4  &= v_{3,2} + v_{3,4} + f_2 = 1
  \end{align*}

  since $f_2$ is a boundary condition and therefore its value is known,
  it ends up on the right side.

</p>

<p>

  To summarize, if we take the partial derivative of our energy
  function $h$ with respect to all the variables, and set them to
  zero, we obtain the system of linear equations.

  \begin{align*}
  2f_3 - f_4 &= 1 \\
  -f_3 + 2f_4 - f_5 &= 3 \\
  -f_4 + 2f_5 - f_6 &= -3 \\
  -f_5 + 2f_6 &= 8 \\
  \end{align*}

  We write this system in terms of matrices,

  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{bmatrix}
  2 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
  -1 & 2 & -1 & 0 \\
  0 & -1 & 2 & -1 \\
  0 & 0 & -1 & 2 \\

  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
  f_3 \\
  f_4 \\
  f_5 \\
  f_6 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  1 \\
  3 \\
  -3 \\
  8 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \end{equation*}

To recover the original image, we simply give this linear system to a
  linear solver(in our code, we
  used <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page">Eigen</a>
  and
  a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesky_decomposition">Cholesky
  Decomposition</a> for solving), and it will give us back
  the original image. <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=solve+%7B+%7B2,+-1,+0,+0%7D,+%7B-1,+2,+-1,+0%7D,+%7B0,+-1,+2,+-1%7D,+%7B0,+0,+-1,+2%7D+%7D+*+%7B%7Bf_3%7D,+%7Bf_4%7D,+%7Bf_5%7D,%7Bf_6%7D%7D+%3D+%7B%7B1%7D,+%7B3%7D,+%7B-3%7D,+%7B8%7D+%7D">This can easily be verified by
  Wolfram Alpha</a>.

</p>

  <h2>Poisson Blending</h2>

  <p>
  We have shown that the original image can be reconstructed from the
  gradients and a number of boundary conditions. We will next
  demonstrate how this fact can be used to seamlessly copy and paste
  one image into another. First, let us say that we have the below
  <i>source image</i>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="/img/poisson_blending/sourcegray.png">
    <img class="article-img"
         src="/img/poisson_blending/sourcegray.png"
         alt="visualization of source image" title="visualization of source
         image"
         width="80%" height="80%"/></a>
</p>

<p>

which can be represented by the bar chart

</p>

<p>
  <a href="/img/poisson_blending/barchart_source.svg">
    <img class="article-img"
         src="/img/poisson_blending/barchart_source.svg"
         alt="barchart of source image" title="barchart of
         source image"
         width="40%" height="40%"/></a>
</p>



<p>

We wish to paste the pixels $f_3$, $f_4$, $f_5$ and $f_6$ into the corresponding pixels in the <i>target image</i>, which is
the image we dealt with in the precision section. However, just
copying and pasting those pixel values does not give good results:

</p>

<p>
  <a href="/img/poisson_blending/targetnonblended.png">
    <img class="article-img"
         src="/img/poisson_blending/targetnonblended.png"
         alt="copy and paste with no blending" title="copy and paste
         with no blending"
         width="80%" height="80%"/></a>
</p>

<p>

  The bar chart of the above image allows us to visualize why

  </p>

<p>
  <a href="/img/poisson_blending/barchart_nonblended.svg">
    <img class="article-img"
         src="/img/poisson_blending/barchart_nonblended.svg"
         alt="barchart of non-blended image" title="barchart of
         non-blended image"
         width="40%" height="40%"/></a>
</p>

<p>

The source image has much brighter values than the target image. If
the pixel values from the source image are just copied and pasted,
this will result in a harsh and sudden change of color, from the pixel
$f_2$ to $f_3$. In a two-dimensional image, the result is even more unappealing,
which can be seen in the images in the next section.

</p>

<p>

  The values of the source image must be modified, in order to make
  the transition less harsh. To be more specific, some form of
  blending must be performed between the source and the target
  image. The idea behind poisson blending is simple: we encode the
  target image as gradients, but at the area into which we wish to
  copy and paste the source image, we simply copy and paste
  the <i>gradients</i> of the source image. That is, in the area of
  copy-and-paste, the original gradients are replaced with the source
  gradients, and we then simply recover an image from these
  modified gradients, just like we did in the previous section.

  In the previous section, we took the partial derivative with respect
  to $f_5$ and obtained equation $\eqref{eq:partialderiv}$. However, if we
  are using poisson blending, the gradients on the right side will have
  different values. The gradients will instead be calculated from the
  source image, so that the expression becomes

  \begin{align}
    2f_5 - f_4 - f_6  &= v_{5,4} + v_{5,6} = (g_5 - g_4) + (g_5 - g_6)= 4 + 5 = 9
  \end{align}

  The right hand side assumes a different value, since our gradients
  have been modified. This occurs for all the other three equations in
  the linear system, and the modified linear system becomes

  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{bmatrix}
  2 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
  -1 & 2 & -1 & 0 \\
  0 & -1 & 2 & -1 \\
  0 & 0 & -1 & 2 \\

  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
  f_3 \\
  f_4 \\
  f_5 \\
  f_6 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  10 \\
  -8 \\
  9 \\
  1 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \end{equation*}

  Note that we have used the boundary conditions from the target image, so
  that $f_2 = 4$ and $f_7 = 8$. Solving this system, we obtain the
  poisson blended image seen below.

</p>

<p>
  <a href="/img/poisson_blending/targetblended.png">
    <img class="article-img"
         src="/img/poisson_blending/targetblended.png"
         alt="copy and paste with poisson blending" title="copy and paste
         with poisson blending"
         width="80%" height="80%"/></a>
</p>
<p>

Which can be visualized as

</p>

<p>
  <a href="/img/poisson_blending/barchart_blended.svg">
    <img class="article-img"
         src="/img/poisson_blending/barchart_blended.svg"
         alt="barchart of poisson blended image" title="barchart of
         poisson blended image"
         width="40%" height="40%"/></a>
</p>

<p>

The intensity of the grayscale values in the
source image has been shifted down, so that they have about the same
intensity as the target image. This is thanks to the boundary conditions
$f_2 = 4$, and $f_7 = 8$, which were from our original target
image. The linear system comes from an optimization problem, and this
optimization problem ensures that the gradient of $v_{3,2}$ of our
recovered image is as close as possible to the value $26 - 24 =
2$(gradient of the source image).
In our recovered image, that gradient assumes the value $7 - 4 =
3$. It would have been very unlikely that the recovered image would
have assumed the value $26$ at $f_3$(as in the original source image), because
then the gradient would be $26 - 4 = 22$ in the recovered image, which is a rather large
value, which exactly the situation the solver is strifing to avoid.
</p>

<p>
Another thing that we wish to remark is that even though poisson
blending shifts the color of the source image, it still preserves the
features of it. In the original source image, $f_4$ is smaller than
$f_3$, $f_5$ is greater than $f_4$, and so on, and this also applies
to our recovered image. This information was encoded by the gradients
of the source image. However, it is also important to realize that
poisson blending does not <i>exactly</i> preserve the gradients. In
the recovered image, the gradient $f_{3,4}$ assumes the value $7 - 4 =
3$, but it was $26 - 22 = 4$ in the original source image. In the
previous section, the gradients of the recovered image were identical
to the gradients of the original image. But with poisson blending, the
gradients of a completely different image are pasted into another
image, and the result of this is that the solver is not always able to
recover an image whose gradients exactly match the specified
gradients. But the solver tries to find an image whose gradients match
as close as possible, and in practice, poisson blending yields good
results, which we shall show examples of in the following section.
</p>

<h2>Two-Dimensional Poisson Blending</h2>

<p>
In the previous section, the intuition behind poisson blending was
described for one dimension. Everything in the previous section
generalizes readily to a two-dimensional image. In the one-dimensional
case, there was only a derivative in the $x$-direction, but for two
dimensions, we must also take into account the derivative in the
$y$-direction. However, this fact introduces little additional
complexity, and formulating and minimizing an energy function is just
as straightforward as in one dimension. In the interest of brevity, we
will provide no further details in the article. We provide code that
demonstrates how to implement poisson blending in two dimensions, and
the reader is encouraged to study this code(and the reader is also
referred to equation (6) of <a href="#refone">[1]</a>. This is the
energy function for the two-dimensional case. And (7) represents the
resulting linear system that must be solved to minimize this energy
function. The provided code demonstrates how to convert these
equations to code)
</p>

<p>
We shall now show some results from the technique. In our test image,
we copy and paste a kitten into a library scene. Performing a naive
copy and paste gives far from acceptable results.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="/img/poisson_blending/copy_and_paste_kitten.jpg">
    <img class="article-img"
         src="/img/poisson_blending/copy_and_paste_kitten.jpg"
         alt="naive copy and paste of kitten" title="naive copy and
         paste of kitten"
         width="70%" height="70%"/></a>
</p>

<p>

Naive copy and results in a starkly visible seam. However, using
poisson blending instead completely removes this seam:

</p>

<p>
  <a href="/img/poisson_blending/poisson_blend_kitten.jpg">
    <img class="article-img"
         src="/img/poisson_blending/poisson_blend_kitten.jpg"
         alt="poisson blending of kitten" title="poisson blending of kitten"
         width="70%" height="70%"/></a>
</p>

<p>
It can also be seen that the color of the kitten has been shifted. The
color shift comes from the colors of the boundary conditions, which is the
floor in this case. Note that we specify a mask for the kitten image,
which is illustrated to the right below

</p>

<p>
  <a href="/img/poisson_blending/kittenmask.jpg">
    <img class="article-img"
         src="/img/poisson_blending/kittenmask.jpg"
         alt="mask of kitten image" title="mask of kitten image"
         width="50%" height="50%"/></a>
</p>

<p > We only perform the poisson blending calculations for pixels
   within this red area. This allows us to save much
   performance, since every extra pixel results in an unknown variable
   in our linear system. Many unknown variables result in a huge
   matrix equation that needs to be solved, and solving huge matrix
   equations requires a large amount of calculations and takes
   time. Such a mask image is easy to construct using an external image
   editor such as Photoshop or Gimp. In our case, we utilized Gimp to
   draw a closed loop around the kitten in a separate layer, and then
   finished the mask by performing a simple flood fill, as is
   illustrated below.

</p>

<p>
  <a href="/img/poisson_blending/gimp_mask.jpg">
    <img class="article-img"
         src="/img/poisson_blending/gimp_mask.jpg"
         alt="Creation of a mask in Gimp" title="Creation of a mask in Gimp"
         width="80%" height="80%"/></a>
</p>

<p>

Finally, the boundary conditions in two dimensions, are the pixels on
the border of this red region.

</p>

<p>
  To conclude the article, we will give an example where poisson
  blending does not give very good results. If we poisson blend the below penguin

</p>

<p>
  <a href="/img/poisson_blending/penguin.jpg">
    <img class="article-img"
         src="/img/poisson_blending/penguin.jpg"
         alt="penguin" title="penguin"
         width="110" height="166"/></a>
</p>

<p>

  Into the library scene, then the result is as follows

<p/>

<p>
  <a href="/img/poisson_blending/penguin_library.jpg">
    <img class="article-img"
         src="/img/poisson_blending/penguin_library.jpg"
         alt="penguin library" title="penguin library"
         width="80%" height="80%"/></a>
</p>

<p>
The snow background around the penguin can vaguely be seen in the
modified library image. Poisson blending has merely modified the color
of the snow, but the appearence of the snow is still the same. If the
target and source images have very different backgrounds, then poisson blending
tends to give not very good results. The kitten image had good
results, since it has such a simple background.
</p>

<p>
  This is the end of the article. In
  a <a href="https://github.com/Erkaman/poisson_blend">github
  repository</a>, we provide a commented implementation of poisson
  blending, and also showcase some more images made using the technique.
