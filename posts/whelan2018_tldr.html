I will in this post write down a TL;DR of the paper <a href="https://www.gcc.tu-darmstadt.de/home/proj/mirror_reconstruction/mirror_reconstruction.en.jsp">'Reconstructing Scenes with Mirror and Glass Surfaces'</a>.

<p>
3D Scene reconstruction(where we are scanning in a real world scene, with some scanner hardware,
and making a digital 3d scene representation from it) have problems with scenes with mirrors.	
We need ways of detecting mirrors, so that this issue can be amended. 
The paper describes a technique for this. And it only deals with planar mirrors btw.
</p>


<p>
First, we find the 3D surface of the mirror. That is, we find the
plane equation of the mirror. To our scanner, we attach a tag,a so-called
AprilTag.
The cool thing is that this tag will only be visible in the image seen from the scanner,
if the scanner is facing the mirror. Since the tag is reflected by the mirror, of course.
</p>


<p>
So if this tag is visible in the scanner image, we have found a mirror. Now let's find it's
plane equation:
We keep moving the scanner, so that the tag changes its reflected position in the mirror.
We end up with a list of mirror positions, and every such mirror position has
a corresponding real-world tag position(the physical tag position on the scanner hardware.)
</p>

<p>
Every real-world tag position is basically projected onto the mirror plane,
and become positions on the mirror. These are the positions seen by the scanner.
So we just need to find a plane equation where every real-world tag position
is projected on the approximately the same position, as the mirror position
captured by the scanner.
From this, we can formulate an optimization problem that we can solve, and thus
find the plane  that best mimics how the tag is projected
onto the mirror.
</p>

<p>
So now we have the plane equation of our mirror. But we don't know the boundaries of the 
mirror yet though. From the image seen by the scanner, we calculate a whole bunch of features now.
There is of course likely to be a depth discontinuity between the mirror boundary and the reflective
mirror surface, so we capture this feature.
Also, we look at the intensity of the image. The reflected mirror surface is 
likely to have much more intensity variance, compared to the boring-looking mirror borders.
So the mirror area is likely to have high intensity variance.
Also, if a tag is visible, then that is also strong evidence that a point is part of the 
reflective mirror surface.
Also, geometry that is far away from the mirror plane equation, is also likely to not be part of
the mirror surface, so that is another way of finding areas not part of the mirror.
As I have demonstrated above, we define a whole bunch of features that describes how likely
a point is to be part of the mirror. And then we run an optimization that 
minimizes these feature values, and it thus finds the mirror surface, and its boundaries.
