  goal of this article, is to describe how we can transform some geometry with a transformation matrix,
  and then compute the intersection between the transformed geometry, and some ray. However, we want to do
  this without <it>actually</it> transforming the geometry, since this can be expensive.   
</p>

</p>
  Let us say we have a ray $\mvec{p}(t) = \mvec{o} + \mvec{d}t$, with origin $\mvec{o}$ and direction $\mvec{d}$,
  and we want to find its intersection with some geometry, by finding the value of $t$ for this intersection.

<p>
For an example, consider the intersection between above ray, with the given values of $\mvec{o}$ and $\mvec{d}$. 
and the green geometry. The ray certainly intersects this geometry, and the value of $t$ is $t=2$, since the 
ray is heading straight towards the wall of the geometry, and the distance between $\mvec{o}$ and the wall of the geometry
is 2. Let us now translate this geometry, 4 units upwards on the $y$-axis, by applying the following matrix: 

\begin{equation*}
T = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 4 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation*}

then we get this geometry:

</p>

<p>
  <a href="/img/ray_trace_inverse_ray/trans1.svg">
    <img class="article-img"
         src="/img/ray_trace_inverse_ray/trans1.svg"
         alt="figure" title="figure"
         width="60%" height="60%"/></a>
</p>


<p>

  This translated geometry is intersected by the ray with origin $\mvec{o}=(-4,4)$
and direction $\mvec{d}=(+1,0)$, with again $t=2$. However, is there a way
we can calculate this exact intersection, without having to translate the geometry 
at all. The geometry might be very complex, and have millions upon millions of triangles, so
transforming the whole geometry might be expensive. Also, the geometry might also be 
storing some kind of spatial data structure for fast ray-intersection queries(like a bounding-volume hierarchy), 
which would also have to be updated if we transformed and updated the geometry vertex data.
If we found a way to intersect the translated geometry, without actually having to translate it all,
these costs would become zero. 

</p>

<p>
  So, is there a way to intersect the geometry with the ray, without having to transform
  the geometry at all? Yes, and it is actually rather simple: instead of transforming
  the geometry, we apply the inverse of the transform on the ray. And then, we 
  intersect this inverse transformed ray, with the original geometry. 
  A small example should convince the reader that this is a valid approach. 
  The inverse of the translation matrix $T$ we just used, is 

  \begin{equation*}
T^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & -4 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation*}

If we apply this matrix to the ray with properties $\mvec{o}=(-4,4)$, $\mvec{d}=(+1,0)$, 
we arrive at the following situation:

</p>

<p>
    <a href="/img/ray_trace_inverse_ray/trans2.svg">
      <img class="article-img"
           src="/img/ray_trace_inverse_ray/trans2.svg"
           alt="figure" title="figure"
           width="60%" height="60%"/></a>
</p>

<p>
  Now as we can observe, we can intersect this inverse transformed ray, with the untransformed
  geometry, and by doing so, we arrive at our desired result $t=2$.
</p>

<p>
  One subtle detail here, is that we must make sure to apply this inverse transformation
  on both the ray origin, <i>and</i> direction. To understand this, 
  let us go through a slightly more subtle example. In this example, the 
  transformation matrix is



\begin{equation*}
M = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 4 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix} = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 0 & 4 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
  ,
\end{equation*}

This is a transform that first translates +4 units on the $x$-axis,
and then does a 90 degrees counter-clockwise rotation about the origin $(0,0)$. If we apply
this transform to a geometry, we arrive at the below situation

</p>

<p>
    <a href="/img/ray_trace_inverse_ray/rot0.svg">
      <img class="article-img"
           src="/img/ray_trace_inverse_ray/rot0.svg"
           alt="figure" title="figure"
           width="60%" height="60%"/></a>
</p>

<p>
  
We want to intersect the above ray with the original geometry instead of the transformed
geometry, and so we begin by inverse transforming the ray origin. The inverse of the 
transform is 

\begin{equation*}
M^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 & -4 \\
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

now apply this to the ray origin:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 & -4 \\
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
  -3 \\
  +4  \\
  0 \\
  1
    \end{bmatrix} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
  0 \\
  +3  \\
  0 \\
  1
    \end{bmatrix}

\end{equation*}

And after doing this transform, we obtain:

</p>

<p>
    <a href="/img/ray_trace_inverse_ray/rot1.svg">
      <img class="article-img"
           src="/img/ray_trace_inverse_ray/rot1.svg"
           alt="figure" title="figure"
           width="60%" height="60%"/></a>
</p>

<p>
  And we can see that the ray obviously will not intersect the original geometry
  in this configuration. Because we also need to inverse transform
  the ray direction, so let us do this:

  \begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 & -4 \\
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
  +1 \\
  0  \\
  0 \\
  0
    \end{bmatrix} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
  0 \\
  -1  \\
  0 \\
  0
    \end{bmatrix}

\end{equation*}

And by doing this, we end up with

</p>

<p>
    <a href="/img/ray_trace_inverse_ray/rot2.svg">
      <img class="article-img"
           src="/img/ray_trace_inverse_ray/rot2.svg"
           alt="figure" title="figure"
           width="60%" height="60%"/></a>
</p>

<p>

  Now the ray does intersect the geometry, and the point it does intersect,
  is the same point it would have intersected, on the transformed geometry.
  We highlight these two intersection points in blue for clarity
</p>

<p>
    <a href="/img/ray_trace_inverse_ray/rot3.svg">
      <img class="article-img"
           src="/img/ray_trace_inverse_ray/rot3.svg"
           alt="figure" title="figure"
           width="60%" height="60%"/></a>
</p>

<p>
  As long as we remember to inverse transform both the ray origin and direction,
  we can intersect a transformed geometry, without actually having to transform it.
 Note that the method has one more caveat to it: we can only use this method 
 for rigid transforms. A rigid transform is a transform which consists of only
 rotations and translations. Basically, a rigid transform is not allowed to
 "stretch" or "shrink" an object. If the object is stretched or shrinked, the 
 geometry behind the object changes completely
 (it may become very stretched in one dimension for instance), and we have no choice but to 
 update the spatial data structures, and the vertex data. A rigid transform only
 moves and rotates an object, and so it will never modify the actual geometry of the 
 object. And this is the reason that either transforming the ray, or transforming the object,
 both will result in the same intersection $t$-value.
 
</p>

<p>
  To summarize, if we apply the inverse transform on a ray, where the 
  transform is <i>non</i>-rigid, we will not in the end obtain the value of $t$
  we expected. The reader is encouraged to make a small toy example,
  and confirm this.
