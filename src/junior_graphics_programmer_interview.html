<h1>Interviewing for your First Job as a Graphics Programmer: a
  Checklist of Common Interview Questions</h1>

<p><b>Update 18/3-2018: </b>After posting this article on Twitter and receiving some
  feedback, I added some additional questions that I
  realized I had forgotten about </p>

<p>

I have recently been interviewing at game companies, trying to land a
job as a junior graphics programmer. Having done so, I gained
knowledge of what skills game companies expect of a newly graduated
graphics programmer, and what questions they are likely to ask during
interviews. I will in this article compile these findings into a handy
checklist. The intention is that other newly graduated programmers can
use this list as a way to prepare, by providing them with a list of
topics that they should rehearse before going into their first
interview. However, as a disclaimer, <b>I do not recommend just
memorizing a bunch of answers to these questions</b>. The topics in
this list are topics that you need to understand and master in order
to solve the programming problems that you will encounter as a
professional graphics programmer. Always strive to understand, not to
memorize.

</p>

<p>

The questions that will probably be asked during the interview can be
organized into the categories
of <b>C++</b>, <b>Mathematics</b>, <b>Optimization</b> and <b>Computer
Graphics</b>. As can be observed, these categories are topics that are
central to the day-to-day work of a graphics programmer; C++ is a
language that is pretty commonly used in graphics programming jobs, so
it is natural that there are many questions about this language during
the interview. Further, graphics programming requires a better handle
of math than most other types of programming, so math skills are
paramount. Finally, in order to achieve 60FPS while still rendering a
game with high graphical fidelity, strong optimization skills are a
must. Let us go through a number of common questions in each category.

</p>

<h2>C++ Questions</h2>

<p>
<ul>

  <li>When should you use virtual destructors?(interviewers absolutely
    love this question!)</li>

  <li>What is the difference between allocating memory on the heap
  versus the stack?</li>

  <li>What C++11 and C++14 features are you using?</li>

  <li>What are templates used for?</li>

  <li>Explain the <code>inline</code> keyword</li>

  <li>What is little and big endian?</li>

  <li>Explain what const-correctness is?</li>

  <li>What overhead is associated with calling a virtual function?</li>

  <li>There will probably be some question where you are asked to
  perform some bit twiddling tricks, using operators such as <code>&</code> and <code>|</code> and
  friends</li>

  <li>There will probably be one question where you are asked to do
    something with a linked list, or some other pointer-based data
    structured like a tree. For instance, reversing a linked
    list.</li>

  <li>What is the size of a pointer in C++?(that is, the result
  of <code>sizeof</code> for a pointer)</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>

As a general rule, none of the questions were about advanced language
features. I was for instance never asked to do any template
metaprogramming, which was a relief.

</p>

<h2>Mathematics Questions</h2>

<p>
  There was actually not much variety when it came to the math questions:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>What is a dot product?</li>
  <li>What is a cross product?</li>
  <li>Why should you use quaternions over euler angles?</li>
  <li>How do you use matrices to apply transformations to an object?
  For instance, how do you scale, translate and rotate an object
  with matrices?</li>
  <li>How do you calculate the intersection between a ray and a plane/sphere/triangle?</li>
  <li>Explain concepts like world space, object space and camera space.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>

You will probably also be asked to solve some practical,
graphics-related problems that will involve using dot products, cross
products, and quaternions. But if you are an experienced graphics
programmer, this should pose no
issues.
</p>

<h2>Optimization Questions</h2>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>How can we use a Bounding Volume Hierarchy(or an octree, or
  something similar) to speed up a raytracer?</li>

  <li>Explain about Cache Memory(L1 and L2 caches, and so on) </li>

  <li>What
  is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-oriented_design">Data
      Oriented Design?</a></li>

  <li>Explain how view frustum culling can be optimized using
  multithreading and SIMD(see e.g. the blog
  post by <a href="http://bitsquid.blogspot.se/2016/10/the-implementation-of-frustum-culling.html">Andreas
  Asplund</a>)</li>


  <li>Do you have experience with using performance profiling
  tools for the GPU?</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>

Game companies seem to expect you to have experience with profiling
and optimizing your code using tools such as NVIDIA Nsight, so do get
familiar with
them. Also, <a href="http://pages.tacc.utexas.edu/~eijkhout/Articles/EijkhoutIntroToHPC.pdf">this</a>
is a good book for brushing up on computer architecture topics such as
cache memory.


</p>

<h2>Computer Graphics Questions</h2>

<p>

<ul>
  <li>What anti-aliasing techniques do you know about?(some possible
    techniques are MSAA, MLAA, FXAA and TXAA)</li>

  <li>What are the most common elements of a rendering engine?(common
  elements will be things like a system for handling culling,
  rendering of shadows, handling of light sources with something like
  deferred/forward shading, how materials are handled in the engine,
  and so on)</li>

  <li>What shadow rendering techniques do you know about?(there are
  TONS of shadow rendering techniques out there. Some examples are variance
  shadow mapping and exponential shadow mapping, and the newer <a href="http://cg.cs.uni-bonn.de/aigaion2root/attachments/MomentShadowMapping.pdf">moment
  shadow mapping</a>)</li>

  <li>What are the pros and cons of a deferred renderer?</li>

  <li>Explain to me physically based rendering?</li>

  <li>Can you give an explanation of how
  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_equation">Rendering
  Equation</a> works?</li>

  <li>What is a BRDF? What does it mean to say that a BRDF is "energy
    conserving"?</li>

  <li>What are the performance implications of branching in a
  shader?(hint: read up on the concept of a warp in GPU
  architecture)</li>

  <li>What advantages does newer API:s like Vulkan and DirectX 12
  offer over old API:s like OpenGL and DirectX 11?(hint: primary
  reason is lower driver-overhead)</li>

  <li>What is the last graphics paper you read, and can you explain
    it to me?(this was a pretty common question)</li>

  <li>Describe to me the
  entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_pipeline">graphics
  pipeline?</a>(your answer will probably be pretty long. You will
  explain about the vertex shader and the fragment shader, about perspective
  correct interpolation, about the z-buffer, about double buffering
  the framebuffer, about alpha blending, about transformation
  matrices, about homogeneous coordinates, about reflection models in
  the fragment shader and so on.)</li>

</ul>

</p>

<p>

The last question in particular seems to be pretty common in
interviews for graphics programming jobs. If you are not entirely
confident on all parts of the pipeline, then my general advice is that
you write a small software rasterizer. This is an exercise that allows you
to gain a deep understanding of the pipeline, because writing a software
rasterizer is in many ways similar to implementing the graphics
pipeline from scratch.

</p>

<p>
  Many of the above questions should primarily be considered as
  warm-up questions. There will probably be some more detailed and
  involved questions after them(but I will not disclose them here,
  since the companies I interviewed for would probably not appreciate
  that). However, the above list of questions should give the reader a
  good understanding of what topics he/she will be expected to be
  proficient in.
</p>

<p>
  Some readers may still be in school, and are unsure which courses
  they should be reading, if they are interested in a career in computer
  graphics. My recommendation is to primarily focus your efforts on
  courses that involve High Performance Computing, and Applied
  Mathematics. Regarding programming courses, try to read courses
  involving topics like multithreading, computer architecture, and
  GPGPU, and other topics that are related to High Performance
  Computing. As for math courses, primarily courses with names like
  "Linear Algebra", "Multivariable Calculus"(in USA, this course is
  called "Calculus III" I think), "Probability
  Theory", "Numerical Optimization", "Differential Equations", and
  "Computational Geometry" will be of interest to you. Primarily focus
  your attention on very applied mathematics, and not on more abstract
  math topics such as Topology and Abstract Algebra, as they are not
  that useful in computer graphics.

  </p>

<p>

In general, you are not expected to know about every single subtopic
of computer graphics .The label "computer graphics" covers a vast
array of subtopics, such as global illumination, occlusion culling,
shadow rendering, pathtracing, fluid simulation, geometry processing,
GPGPU, physically based rendering, and so on. Expecting a junior
programmer to know all these topics in detail would be
unreasonable. However, if you put something on your CV, do be prepared
to give detailed answers related to this topic.

</p>

<p>

So you are not expected to know EVERYTHING there is to know about
computer graphics. Instead, what often will happen is that you are
asked to explain about major computer graphics projects that you have worked
on. Then the interviewer will be asking plenty of follow-up questions, and
make you explain your project in detail. So my advice is that, before
the interview, you pick out a couple of projects that you are
especially proud over, and prepare yourself for giving a detailed
explanation of these projects.

</p>

<p>

In my opinion, the best way to prepare for the interview, is to work
on plenty of side projects in your spare time. Showcasing the projects
you have worked on is a good way of selling yourself to the
interviewer, and it allows you to show that you are truly passionate
for this field. Finally, working on these side projects will allow you
to sharpen your programming skills, and this in turn makes it much
easier to answer all the questions I have listed in this article.
