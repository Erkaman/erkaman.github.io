I will in this post write down a TL;DR of the paper <a href="http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/projects/rigid-body-compression/">'Collision-Aware and Online Compression of Rigid Body Simulations via Integrated Error Minimization'</a>.

Storing a rigid body simulation, requires storing the rotations
and translations of all rigid bodies in the simulation, and with many
bodies and small time steps, this can quickly become a huge amount of data.

</p>

<p>
Such a huge amount of data is a big inconvenience, since it takes time to
load from the disk, and time to transmit and share. Compressing it is
desirable.
</p>

<p>
The paper describes an online compression method; that is, it performs
the compression while the simulation is being performed. So it doesn't require
all the simulation data to be in memory when compressing, which is a big plus.
</p>

<p>
Here's how we compress the trajectory(that is, the translations over time),
of a rigid body: we fit several spline polynomials that follows the trajectory as close as
possible. Basic Algorithm: get translation for next timestep, refit our current polynomial to the trajectory,
now that we are aware of another timestep.
Get next translation, refit polynomial again, and so on.
</p>

<p>
The algorithm keeps track of the error(difference) between the polynomial(that approximated the trajectory)
and the true trajectory. If error grows too large => output current polynomial, and then
start a new polynomial.
</p>

<p>
They also need to do fitting on the rotations over time.
For this, they found that it worked better to use a modified slerp formula,
instead of polynomials.
