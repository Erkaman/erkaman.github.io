  this article, we describe an approach to smoothly filling holes in
  broken meshes that is based
  on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations">variational
  calculus</a>. However, do note that it is not assumed that the
  reader has experience in variational calculus, and we will instead
  introduce the necessary concepts from this topic when they are
  needed. Most of the techniques described in this article are based
  the description of Surface Fairing in section 4.3
  of <a href="#refone">[1]</a>. In the below image, it is shown how
  our described algorithm can be used to smoothly and naturally fill
  holes in a broken mesh.

<h2>Our Approach</h2>

<p>

First, we shall describe our general approach to solving the
problem. Let us say we have some geometry with a hole, and from the
side, it looks like this

</p>

<p>
  <a href="/img/hole_filling/barchart_hole.svg">
    <img class="article-img"
         src="/img/hole_filling/barchart_hole.svg"
         alt="barchart with hole" title="barchart with hole"
         width="40%" height="40%"/></a>
</p>


<p>

As can be observed, we describe the height at every point with a
function $f$, so that $f(1)$ is the height of the first vertex, and so
on. At $x=1$, $x=2$, $x=7$ and $x=8$ there are vertices, but in
between, there is a hole at $x=3$, $x=4$, $x=5$, $x=6$. We wish to add
a <i>patch</i> of four vertices at these four points that fills the hole, and we also want
to ensure the height of these vertices follows the general curvature
around the hole. We will find these four heights by formulating a
system of equations, and then solving it, so that the obtained
solution is the values of $f(3)$, $f(4)$, $f(5)$ and $f(6)$.

</p>

<p>

What kind of solution would be a good and desirable
solution? We claim a solution like the below is a good solution

</p>

<p>
  <a href="/img/hole_filling/barchart_good_solution.svg">
    <img class="article-img"
         src="/img/hole_filling/barchart_good_solution.svg"
         alt="barchart with good solution" title="barchart with good solution"
         width="40%" height="40%"/></a>
</p>

<p>
  While the below solution is a bad solution
</p>

<p>
  <a href="/img/hole_filling/barchart_bad_solution.svg">
    <img class="article-img"
         src="/img/hole_filling/barchart_bad_solution.svg"
         alt="barchart with bad solution" title="barchart with bad solution"
         width="40%" height="40%"/></a>
</p>

<p>

In the bad solution, the patch that fills the hole, is simply a linear
interpolation from $x=2$ to $x=7$. The issue with such a solution is
that it poorly preserves the slopes(that is, the derivatives) of the
surroundings of the patch. The derivative at some point $x$ can be
approximated as

\[
f_x(x) =  \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} = f(x + 1) - f(x)
\]

where we have let the step size be $h = 1$, and where we are using the
notation $f_x(x) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ to denote the first
derivative with respect to $x$, and then the second derivative is denoted
$f_{xx}(x)$. Observe that $f_x(1) = 5 - 2 = 3$. In the good
solution, we have that $f_x(2) = 2.1$, but in the bad solution we have
$f_x(2) = 0.2$. The derivative at $f_x(2)$ is much closer to the
derivative at $f_x(1)$ in the good solution compared to the bad. The
change in derivative is smaller for the good solution, and this
results in the transition from $f(2)$ to $f(3)$ being a much more
natural transition, since this transition is more consistent with the
derivatives of the surrounding vertices. To summarize, we desire a
small change in the value of the derivative, as we go from one vertex
to its neighbour. The change of derivative is simply the second
derivative, and we wish to minimize this quantity over the patch.

</p>

<p>

  This point is very important and the key of the technique, so let us
  clarify it even more: the first derivative, $f_x(x)$, measures how
  the function $f(x)$ changes as we go from $x$ to $x+1$. Then the
  definition of the second derivative, $f_{xx}(x)$ , is obvious: it
  measures the change of $f_x(x)$ as we go from $x$ to $x+1$. In order
  to create a smooth patch that naturally follows the curvature around
  the hole, we will create a patch that minimizes the second
  derivative.

</p>

<h2>Minimizing the Second-Derivative with Variational Calculus</h2>

<p>

In this section, we will implement the approach described in the
previous section. Our objective is to find some function $f(x)$, that
describes a patch that has the requirements we described in the
previous section. For the case of our example, we already know the
values of this function for $x=1$, $x=2$, $x=7$ and $x=8$, but we need
to solve and find the values for $x=3$, $x=4$, $x=5$ and $x=6$. The example
function we have been dealing with up until this point has been a
discrete function $f(x)$, that is only defined at the integers. We
will now temporarily move from the discrete domain into the continuous
domain, since this allows us to use the powerful tools of variational
calculus. Henceforth, $f$ is not only defined for values such as $x=2$
and $x=6$, but also for values such as $x=1.2$ and $x=1.5$.

</p>

<p>

  We wish to find a function $f(x)$, such that the second derivative
  is minimal at all points in the patch. Then it is natural to define the energy function

  \[
  E(f) = \int_a^b (f_{xx})^2\ dx
  \]

  (This integral would not have been possible in the discrete
  domain!)The above integral can be seen as a sum. Put in a simplified
  way, it evaluates the value of $(f_{xx})^2$ at many, many points in
  the interval $[a, b]$, and then adds all these evaluations together
  into one large sum. If this integral is small, then the second
  derivatives in the interval $[a, b]$ will be small, and this means
  $f$ is a good patch by our requirements. Note that $a$ and $b$ are
  the boundary points of the patch, and the boundary is $x=2$ and
  $x=7$ for the example function.

</p>

<p>

  In order to find the $f$ that minimizes $E(f)$, we utilize a
  common approach of variational calculus: First, we assume that
  $f$ is the minimizer of $E(f)$. Further, let $u(x)$ be any function
  that is defined in the interval $[a,b]$, and is once differentiable in
  this interval(this means that we can compute its first derivative in this
  interval), and that further satisfies $u(a) = u(b) = 0$ and $u_x(a) =
  u_x(b) = 0$. It will soon become clear why we are doing this.

</p>
<p>

  Consider now the function $E(f(x) + u(x)\lambda)$. This is a
  function where we are adding a certain amount of $u(x)$ to $f(x)$
  and then giving this sum to $E()$. How much of $u(x)$ that we add to
  $f(x)$ is controlled by the scalar $\lambda$. We assumed that $f(x)$
  is the minimizer of $E(f)$, and this implies that $\lambda=0$ is the
  minimizer of $E(f(x) + u(x)\lambda)$. But this means that the
  derivative of $E(f(x) + u(x)\lambda)$ with respect to $\lambda$ must
  be $0$ when $\lambda = 0$(since the derivative is zero at the
  minimum point). That is

  \[
  \frac{\partial E(f(x) + u(x)\lambda)}{\partial\lambda}

   \bigg\rvert_{\lambda = 0}= 0
  \]

  We shall now expand and simplify the left-hand side. For
  convenience, we will onward write $u(x)$ as $u$ and $f(x)$ as
  $f$. First observe that

  \[

  E(f + u\lambda) = \int_b^a ( (f + u\lambda)_{xx} )^2\ dx = \int_b^a
  (f_{xx} + u_{xx}\lambda)^2\ dx

  \]

  Next we compute the derivative with respect to $\lambda$.

  \[
  \frac{\partial E(f + u\lambda)}{\partial\lambda} =

  \frac{\partial}{\partial\lambda}\left(\int_b^a (f_{xx} +
  u_{xx}\lambda)^2\ dx\right) = \int_a^b 2(f_{xx} +
  u_{xx}\lambda)u_{xx}\ dx
  \]

  (we have here performed differentiation under the integral, and this
  is completely acceptable by
  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_integral_rule">Leibniz's
  rule</a>). When $\lambda=0$, the right-hand side must equal zero,
  and thus it follows


  \[
    \int_a^b f_{xx}u_{xx}\ dx = 0
  \]

  Recall that $u(a) = u(b) = 0$ and $u_x(a) = u_x(b) = 0$. By using
  these facts and integration by parts, it is possible to simplify the
  above even further. Integration by parts yields

  \[
  \int_a^b f_{xx}u_{xx} dx = [f_{xx}u_x]^b_a - \int_a^b f_{xxx} u_x\ dx = 0
  \]

  However, $u_x(a) = u_x(b) = 0$, and thus it simplifies to

  \[
    \int_a^b f_{xxx} u_x\ dx = 0
  \]

  Integrate by parts again

  \[
  \int_a^b f_{xxx} u_x dx = [f_{xxx}u]^b_a - \int_a^b f_{xxxx}u\ dx = 0
  \]

  But $u(a) = u(b) = 0$, so we can simplify as

  \[
  \int_a^b f_{xxxx}u\ dx = 0
  \]

  Finally, here comes the coup de grace. Recall our definition of
  $u(x)$: it is <i>any</i> function that satisfies $u(a) = u(b) = 0$
  and $u_x(a) = u_x(b) = 0$, and is once differentiable. How can we
  ensure that the above equality is satisfied, while still letting
  $u(x)$ be any function? The only possible way to satisfy such a
  strong condition, is by requiring that

  \[
  f_{xxxx} = 0
  \]

  That is, $f_{xxxx}$ must <i>always</i> be zero within our domain
  $[a,b]$. This implies that the minimizer of $E(f)$ is a function whose fourth
  derivative is always zero within the domain. We will use this fact
  to solve for the minimizer $f$ in the following section.

</p>

<p>
  However, note that instead of solving for the $f$ whose fourth
  derivative with respect to $x$ is zero, we will find the $f$ whose
  bi-laplacian is zero, which is of course equivalent to the
  former. We are in this example dealing with only one dimension, and
  the laplacian in one dimension is simply $\Delta f = f_{xx}$. This
  means that our condition $f_{xxxx} = 0$ is equivalent to

  \[
  \Delta\Delta f = \Delta^2 f = 0
  \]

  where $\Delta^2$ is often called the bi-laplacian or the
  bi-harmonic operator, which is just the laplacian of the
  laplacian. The laplacian is more commonly used in notation than the
  fourth derivative, so this is why we are formulating our condition
  in terms of the laplacian.

</p>

<h2>Discretizing and Solving for the Minimizer </h2>

<p>

In the beginning, we showed a function with bar charts with a hole in
it, and now we will show how to find the minimizer that fills this
hole, and at the same time make sure that the second derivatives are
minimal. The minimizer $f$ must satisfy the condition

\[
\Delta\Delta f = \Delta^2 f = 0
\]

However, this condition is in the continuous domain, and our bar chart
is in the discrete domain, and so is a 3D mesh. In practical
applications, discrete domains are very common, and so the
bi-laplacian must be discretized. We will demonstrate how this can be
done in the one-dimensional case. The bi-laplacian is the fourth
derivative in one dimension. The first step is to discretize the first
derivative, using central differences.

\[
f_x(x) = \frac{f(x + 0.5h) - f(x - 0.5h)}{h} = f(x+0.5) - f(x-0.5)
\]

Where we used a step length of $h=1$, the smallest possible step length
in our discrete problem. The second derivative, is the
derivative of the first derivative

\[
\Delta f(x) = f_{xx}(x) = f_x(x+0.5) - f_x(x-0.5) = f(x-1) - 2f(x) + f(x+1)
\]

Finally, the bi-laplacian is just the laplacian of the laplacian

\[
\Delta^2 f(x) = f_{xxxx}(x) = f_{xx}(x-1) - 2f_{xx}(x) + f_{xx}(x+1) =
f(x-2) - 4f(x-1) + 6f(x) - 4f(x+1) + f(x+2)
\]

Now we can finally solve for $f$ in our bar chart problem. First,
observe that we desire to have $\Delta^2 f(3) = 0$. Using our
discretization scheme, this can be simplified to

\[
f(1) - 4f(2) + 6f(3) - 4f(4) + f(5) = 0
\]

And same type of linear equation also holds for $f(4)$, $f(5)$, and
$f(6)$. We summarize all these linear equations into a single matrix
equation

\[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  1 & -4 & 6 & -4 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 & -4 & 6 & -4 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & -4 & 6 & -4 & 1 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -4 & 6 & -4 & 1 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\

  \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
  f(1) \\
  f(2) \\
  f(3) \\
  f(4) \\
  f(5) \\
  f(6) \\
  f(7) \\
  f(8) \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  2 \\
  5 \\
  0 \\
  0 \\
  0 \\
  0 \\
  6 \\
  3 \\

 \end{bmatrix}
\]

Note that rows 1, 2, 7 and 8 simply specify the values at the
boundaries of the bar chart. These are the boundary conditions of our
problem, and must be specified in order to create a solvable
equation. The remaining rows specify that the bi-laplacians of the
unknown variables $f(3)$, $f(4)$, $f(5)$, $f(6)$ must equal
zero. However, this matrix equation can be simplified. For row 3,
we have

\[
f(1) - 4f(2) + 6f(3) - 4f(4) + f(5) = 0
\]

But since the values of $f(1)=2.0$ and $f(2)=5.0$ are known, we can
move some constant values to the right-hand side, keeping only the
variables on the left side:

\[
6f(3) - 4f(4) + f(5) = 18
\]

We do the same for the other three linear equations, and remove rows
1,2, 7 and 8, since these rows are now redundant. Our simplified matrix
equation is

\[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  6 & -4 & 1 & 0 \\
  -4 & 6 & -4 & 1 \\
  1 & -4 & 6 & -4 \\
  0 & 1 & -4 & 6 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
  f(3) \\
  f(4) \\
  f(5) \\
  f(6) \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  18 \\
  -5 \\
  -6 \\
  21 \\
 \end{bmatrix}
\]

If we solve, we obtain our solution below, which is also the good
solution that we showed earlier.

<h2>Smooth 3D Hole-Filling Surface Patches</h2>

<p>

We have shown how to smoothly fill holes in the one-dimensional
case. We will now briefly discuss how to smoothly fill holes in 3D
meshes. Most of the reasoning from the one-dimensional case carries
over to the 3D case, so this discussion will be more brief.

</p>

<p>
First, we locate the hole in the mesh. The below image illustrates
this hole
</p>

<p>
  <a href="/img/hole_filling/bunnyhole1.png">
    <img class="article-img"
         src="/img/hole_filling/bunnyhole1.png"
         alt="bunny hole" title="bunny hole"
         width="40%" height="40%"/></a>
</p>

<p>
and then compute the center position of the vertices in the hole
boundary(this is the average of the vertex positions). The vertices in
the boundary are connected with a newly created vertex at the center
position, thus creating a surface patch that fills the hole. The
triangles in this patch are also upsampled(subdivided), so that we
have more vertices to manipulate for when we will be making the patch
more smooth. The result can be seen below

</p>

<p>
  <a href="/img/hole_filling/bunnyhole2.png">
    <img class="article-img"
         src="/img/hole_filling/bunnyhole2.png"
         alt="bunny hole filled with flat patch" title="bunny hole
         filled with flat patch"
         width="40%" height="40%"/></a>
</p>

<p>
  Note that we also upsampled the triangles of the original bunny
  mesh, since this makes it very easy to fuse together the vertices of the
  original patch and the original geometry. By "fuse", we mean that we
  ensure that the boundary of the original mesh, and the boundary of
  the patch share the same vertices.
</p>

<p>

Next, we create a smooth patch by solving the equation $\Delta^2 f =
0$ on the patch. We need to discretize the laplace operator to achieve this,
and the discretization of the laplace operator on the surface of a
mesh is called
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%E2%80%93Beltrami_operator">Laplace-Beltrami</a>
operator. This is a topic that is too large to be covered in this
article, and will probably be the subject of a future
article. Instead, we mention
that <a href="https://github.com/libigl/libigl">libigl</a> provides
code that creates the discretized Laplace-Beltrami operator, and then
solves the equation $\Delta^2 f = 0$. This is what we used in our demo
implementation of the technique. We solve for $f$, and the results can
be seen below

</p>

<p>
  <a href="/img/hole_filling/bunnyhole3.png">
    <img class="article-img"
         src="/img/hole_filling/bunnyhole3.png"
         alt="bunny hole filled with smoothed patch" title="bunny hole
         filled with smoothed patch"
         width="40%" height="40%"/></a>
</p>

<p>
  Finally, we downsample the mesh, using a mesh decimation algorithm.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="/img/hole_filling/bunnyhole4.png">

         filled with smoothed patch"
         width="40%" height="40%"/></a>
</p>

<p>
  This concludes the article. In
  a <a href="https://github.com/Erkaman/hole_fixer">github
  repository</a>, we provide a commented implementation of the
  technique implemented with libigl and Eigen.
