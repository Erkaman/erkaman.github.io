            You have arrived at my personal website. This website is
            my portfolio, and everything that I have coded throughout
            the years is summarized here.
          </p>

          <p>
            My name is Eric Arneb√§ck, and I am currently a student of
            Computer Science at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalmers_University_of_Technology">Chalmers University of Technology</a> in
            Gothenburg, Sweden. While I'm studying, I also work part-time as a graphics programmer at <a href="http://www.fcc.chalmers.se/">Fraunhofer-Chalmers
            Centre</a>. As you can probably tell from the
            below <a href="#gallery">gallery</a>, my main topic of
            interest is Computer Graphics(mainly using WebGL and OpenGL), and most of my side
            projects are related to this, but sometimes I also dabble
            in GPGPU, Machine Learning, and Reverse Engineering. I
            spend much of my spare time working on various side
            projects.
          </p>

          <p> I live in a town
            called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skene,_Sweden">Skene</a>
            in Sweden, which is about 45 minutes by car from
            Gothenburg. And when I am not working on my side projects,
            I like to go on long walks.
            </p>
