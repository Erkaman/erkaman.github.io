            You have arrived at my personal website. This website is
            my portfolio, and everything that I have coded thoughout
            the years is summarized here.
          </p>

          <p>
            My name is Eric Arneb√§ck, and I am currently a student of
            computer
            of <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/programmes/masters-info/Pages/Computer-Science-algorithms-languages-and-logic.aspx">Computer
            Science</a> at Chalmers University of Technology in
            Gothenburg, Sweden. My main topic of interest is Computer
            Graphics, and most of my side projects are related to
            this, but sometimes I also dabble in GPGPU, Machine
            Learning, and Reverse Engineering. I spend much of my
            spare time working on various side projects.





          </p>

          <p> I live in a town
            called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skene,_Sweden">Skene</a>
            in Sweden, which is about 45minutes by car from
            Gothenburg. And when I am not working on my side projects,
            I like to go on long walks.
            </p>
