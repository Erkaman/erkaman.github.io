            You have arrived at my personal website. This website is
            my portfolio, and everything that I have coded throughout
            the years is summarized here.
          </p>

          <p>
            My name is Eric Arneb√§ck, and I am a development engineer
            working with computer graphics
            at <a href="http://www.fcc.chalmers.se/">Fraunhofer-Chalmers
            Centre of Industrial Mathematics</a>.

            As you can probably tell from the
            below <a href="#gallery">gallery</a>, my main topic of
            interest is Computer Graphics(mainly using WebGL and
            OpenGL), and most of my side projects are related to this,
            but sometimes I also dabble in GPGPU, Machine Learning,
            and Reverse Engineering. I spend much of my spare time
            working on various side projects. Finally, I live in
            Gothenburg in Sweden
