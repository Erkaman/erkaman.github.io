<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
  Voxel cone tracing is a real-time method that approximates global
  illumination using a voxel approximation of the original
  scene. However, a high-resolution voxel approximation, which is
  necessary for good quality, consumes much memory, and a compact data
  structure for storing the voxels is necessary. In this thesis, as a
  primary contribution, we provide a comparison of two such data
  structures: a Sparse Voxel Octree, and a Clipmap.
</p>

<p>
We implement these two data structures, and provide detailed
descriptions of both with many important implementation details. These
descriptions are much more complete than what exists in the current
literature, and it is the secondary contribution of this thesis.
</p>

<p>
In the comparison, we find that the octree performs worse than the
clipmap with respect to memory consumption and performance, due to the
overhead introduced by the complex octree data structure. However,
with respect to visual quality, the octree is the superior choice,
since the clipmap does not provide the same voxel resolution
everywhere.

<h2>Author's Comments</h2>

<p>
  This is my master's thesis, where I performed a comparison between
  the two data structures Clipmap and Sparse Voxel Octree for voxel cone
  tracing. To do this comparison, I had to implement both of these two
  data structures, and about half-way into the project I realized that
  this was a vastly over-ambitious project. Many things took much more
  time than I had initially anticipated, and so there simply was not
  enough time to do everything I wanted to do in the end. The current
  literature and scientific papers about this topic is very sparse on
  details, and only describes the very tip of the iceberg. As a
  result, you basically have to rediscover much of what the previous
  authors did by trying different approaches and experimenting a
  lot. This consumes much time, and resulted in my initial time
  schedule not working out in the end.
</p>

<p>
  I wanted to spend more time optimizing my implementation of both
  data structures, but I was not able to do very much optimization due
  to time constraints. I wanted to implement anisotropic voxels to
  decrease issues with light-leakage, and I was able to implement it
  for the clipmap, but not for the octree, so that part had to be
  scrapped from my comparison. Implementing the octree and adding
  features to it was a massive headache, because it is not difficult
  to accidentaly create subtle bugs that only appear in large,
  unwieldy octrees that are difficult debug. Many hours ended up being
  spent on debugging the octree.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, my implementation of both data structures don't look
  that great visually in my opinion, and that is because I couldn't
  spend very much time on making it look good due to time
  constraints. Because of this, my comparison is not very focused on
  comparing the differences of visual quality of the data structures,
  and instead it is mainly focused on performance comparisons.
</p>

<p>
  I was, however, very satisfied with my final report. As I already
  mentioned, the current literature on the topic can be very sparse,
  and my report describes several important implementation details
  that are not described anywhere else. I hope that my report shall
  make it easier for people to implement these techniques in the
  future.
</p>

<p>
  While I probably sounded very negative in the above paragraphs, I am
  overall satisfied with how my Master's Thesis turned out, and I
  learned tons from this project. Hopefully, I will learn from this
  project and become more skilled at making reasonable time
  estimations in the future :-)
